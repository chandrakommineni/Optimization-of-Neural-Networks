We will start by exploring the optimization aspects of deep network training. Throughout this journey, you will gain insights into:

**Part 1:**
- The fundamentals of simple gradient descent.
- The concept of weight decay.
- A deep understanding of PyTorch autograd and PyTorch optimizers.

**Part 2:**
- Analyzing raw gradients, means, and RMS (Root Mean Square).
- Delving into exponential moving averages.
- Exploring the workings of the ADAM optimization algorithm.

**Part 3:**
- Strategies for optimizing neural network parameters.
- Selecting appropriate nonlinearities, architectures, and layers to tackle the vanishing gradient problem.
- Leveraging techniques like regularization, parameterization, and specific layer choices to enhance generalization.
- Unpacking the roles and impacts of ADAM, ReLU activation, weight decay, network depth, network width, residual architectures, and batch normalization in deep learning.
